'''
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. The task is to complete the function transitionPoint() 
that takes array and N as input parameters and returns the 0 based index of the position where "0" ends and "1" begins.
If array does not have any 1s, return -1. If array does not have any 0s, return 0.

Method 1:
O(N)
def transitionPoint(arr, n):
    #Code here
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i]==1:
            return i
    return -1
    
Method 2:
#Using Binary Search
(log N)

def transitionPoint(arr, n):
    #Code here
    low=0
    high=n-1
    while low<=high:
        mid=(low+high)//2
        if arr[mid]==0:
            low=mid+1
        elif arr[mid]==1:
            if mid==0 or (mid>0 and arr[mid-1]==0):
                return mid
            high=mid-1
    return -1
