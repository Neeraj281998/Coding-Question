You are given two arrays, A and B, of equal size N. The task is to find the minimum value of 
A[0] * B[0] + A[1] * B[1] +â€¦+ A[N-1] * B[N-1], where shuffling of elements of arrays A and B is allowed.


    def minValue(self, a, b, n):
        # Your code goes here
        a.sort()
        b.sort()
        start=0
        end=n-1
        count=0
        while(start<n):
            count+=a[start]*b[end]
            start+=1
            end-=1
        return count
