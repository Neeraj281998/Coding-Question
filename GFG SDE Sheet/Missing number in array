Given an array of size N-1 such that it only contains distinct integers in the range of 1 to N. Find the missing element.

class Solution:
    def MissingNumber(self,array,n):
        # code here
        count=0
        arrSum=0
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            count+=i
        for i in array:
            arrSum+=i
            
        return count-arrSum
