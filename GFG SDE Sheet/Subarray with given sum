Given an unsorted array A of size N that contains only non-negative integers, find a continuous sub-array which adds to a given number S.

In case of multiple subarrays, return the subarray which comes first on moving from left to right.



def subArraySum(self,arr, n, s): 
       #Write your code here
        count=0
        left=0
        for i in range(n):
            count+=arr[i]
            while(count>s):
                count-=arr[left]
                left+=1
            if count==s:
                return[left+1,i+1]
        return [-1]
