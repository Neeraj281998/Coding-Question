Given two sorted arrays arr1[] and arr2[] of sizes n and m in non-decreasing order. Merge them in sorted order without using any extra space. Modify arr1 so that it contains the first N elements and modify arr2 so that it contains the last M elements.


 def merge(self,arr1,arr2,n,m):
        #code here
        for i in range(m-1,-1,-1):
            last=arr1[n-1]
            j=n-2
            
            while (j>=0 and arr1[j]>arr2[i]):
                arr1[j+1]=arr1[j]
                j-=1
            
            if (j!=n-2 or last>arr2[i]):
                arr1[j+1]=arr2[i]
                arr2[i]=last
