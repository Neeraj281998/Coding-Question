Largest Number formed from an Array 
Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them in such a manner that they form the largest number possible.The result is going to be very large, hence return the result in the form of a string.


	def printLargest(self,arr):
	    result=''
	    # code here
	    for i in range(len(arr)):
	        arr[i]=str(arr[i])
	    for i in range(len(arr)):
	        for j in range(i+1,len(arr)):
	            if (arr[j]+arr[i])>(arr[i]+arr[j]):
                    arr[j],arr[i]=arr[i],arr[j]
        for i in arr:
            result+=i
        return result
